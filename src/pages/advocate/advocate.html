      It is simply not acceptable for people to live on the streets; it is not good for them, and it is not good for the city. We will tackle this complicated issue, and we will do it humanely with a meaningful approach that balances the needs of the homeless and the concerns of neighborhoods they impact.

    <h3>Take the pledge</h3>
    <p>
      I promise to support The Way Home's mission to end chronic and veteran homelessness in Houston by 2015, to end family and youth homelessness by 2020, and to build a system in which nobody has to be without permanent housing for more than 30 days.
