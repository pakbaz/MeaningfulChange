This is the sourceCode for the Meaningful Change project presented for Houston Hackaton Contest

## Inspiration
On an average night in 2016, more than 3,600 homeless people could be found on our streets and in our shelters.  Chronic homelessness requires a strategic response and most often, the work of multiple agencies and the community to help the most vulnerable in our city reach their goals of safe shelter and a way back into society.  Mayor Sylvester Turner has invited the community to help implement an anti-panhandling awareness campaign in an effort to redirect “street donations” to fund more shelter beds, new public health and safety regulations and ultimately more stability in their lives.

## What it does
The app encourages the community to react in a meaningful way, rather than enabling those experiencing homelessness to stay on the streets.

## How we built it
The 'Team Hess' consisted of members with different areas of expertise:
- Front-end development was done on Ionic framework
- Middle-tier API layer was built on Azure Functions
- Backend database on Azure SQL
- Administrative reporting on TIBCO Spotfire

## About The App

To Run the app you need Ionic 3 installed available through node package manager. You might need to have iOS and android SDK installed on your machine.
